# Rogue Galleons!
Rogue Galleons! is a Roguelike - like Pirate adventure set upon The Seven Seas!
Command your ship and crew, and embark on a quest for fame and treasure on the ever-changing ocean. Beware though Captain, for the seas are unforgiving, and the dangers are a'plenty.

Can you survive long enough to find what was lost, and become the most daring captain on the ocean blue?

Main Features:
- Ability to pause gameplay for strategic decision-making and resource allocation.
- Death is final. Risk & Reward increased through only having 1 life per run (Can repair ship damage though)
- Make upgrades to your ship & crew. Unlock new ways to play with whatever you can find...
- Brightly coloured, semi-pixelated graphics style
- Cool Soundtrack (Inspiration from other pirate game mixed with pixealed theme type music)
- Map with several options for progression
